TimberZ is a Minecraft plugin that let's you cut down trees in an instant. You can either have it always active, toggleable, make special lumberjack axes or have a custom enchantment.

## Features
- ✅ Advanced Tree Detection
- ✅ Custom Enchantment
- ✅ Customizable Tree Types
- ✅ Cutting down animation
- ✅ Instant Leaf Decay
- ✅ Toggleable Timber mode
- ✅ Custom item support
- ✅ HEX Colors
- ✅ Highly customizable
- ✅ Customizable messages
- ✅ Easy setup
- ✅ Multiple languages

## Permissions

- `timberz.usetimber` - Allows the player to use TimberZ. (true by default)
- `timberz.admin` - Allows the player to use admin commands. (Only for OPs by default)

## Compatability

### ✅ PlaceholderAPI

TimberZ supports PlaceholderAPI, allowing you to use placeholders in your messages and configurations:

- `%timberz_can_timber%` - Returns true if the player can use TimberZ. This takes permissions, regions and other restrictions into account.

### ✅ WorldGuard

TimberZ supports WorldGuard, allowing you to restrict TimberZ usage in certain regions. You can use the `timber` flag to allow or disallow TimberZ usage in a region.

### ✅ AuraSkills

Using TimberZ with AuraSkills, gives players the correct amount of experience when cutting down trees. You can also add a custom XP multiplier to the TimberZ configuration file.

## Configuration

You can find the configuration files in the `plugins/TimberZ` folder. The main configuration file is `config.yml`, and you can also find a `blocks.yml` file that contains the block mappings for logs, leaves, and saplings.

## Custom Enchantment Translation

The Timber enchantment uses the translation key `enchantment.timberz.timber`. If you want to customize the name displayed to players, you can create or update your server’s resource pack with a custom translation.

### How to Add Custom Translations

Add a language file to your resource pack at `assets/timberz/lang/en_us.json` (or another language code) with the following content:

```json
{
  "enchantment.timberz.timber": "Your Custom Name"
}
```

For example, if you want to call it "Lumberjack" instead of "Timber":

```json
{
  "enchantment.timberz.timber": "Lumberjack"
}
```

For detailed information on resource pack structure and how to configure them on your server, refer to:

- [Minecraft Wiki: Resource pack - Directory structure](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Directory_structure)
- [Minecraft Wiki: Server.properties - resource-pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Server.properties#resource-pack)

Players will then see your custom name for the enchantment in the enchanting table, anvil, and item tooltips.
